# kbcitrite's scripts repo
This repository is where I share scripts with the general public, which is primarily Citrix-related for the time being.

Check out my [PowerShell module](https://github.com/kbcitrite/scripts/tree/master/Citrix/ADM) for Citrix ADM, as well as the ['ADM Power'](https://github.com/kbcitrite/scripts/tree/master/Citrix/ADMPower) utility.
